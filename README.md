# Prototypes for a HOT (Heat Orchestration Template) DSL for OpenStack Heat

This repo is a space for people to evolve a DSL for Heat, based on the
AWS CloudFormation clone (heat-cfn) and a proposal from Rackspace 
([https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat/DSL]).

One of the activities here is taking some of the pre-existing templates
(at [https://gist.github.com/hardys/5408410]) and expressing them in various
DSLs and making notes about what works well and not.
