# Prototypes for a HOT (Heat Orchestration Template) DSL for OpenStack Heat

This repo is a space for people to evolve a DSL for Heat, based on the
AWS CloudFormation clone (heat-cfn) and a proposal from Rackspace 
[Heat/DSL](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat/DSL).

One of the activities here is taking some of the pre-existing templates
(at [gist 5408410](https://gist.github.com/hardys/5408410)) and expressing them in various
DSLs and making notes about what works well and not.

See also a list of open questions in [etherpad](https://etherpad.openstack.org/heat-dsl-questions).

### Variants

* **root**: contains the original CFN templates
* **alex1**: variant based on components and requirements (see [notes](alex1/notes.md))
